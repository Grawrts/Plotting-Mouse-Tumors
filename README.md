Prepared the data by combining DataFrames, then checked for duplicate datapoints. After removing the duplicate mice, generates summary statistics for each drug regimen. Included mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume.
Created two bar charts and two pie charts using DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot.
Calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created box plots by looping through the data of the last time point for each mouse. Box plots created with Matplotlib.
